# UFOs
Create dynamic content by organizing UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array.

## Project Overview

	- 1. Build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. 
	- 2. Create filters to make this table fully dynamic, with the functionality of reacting to user input.
	- 3. Place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
		-Use storyboard technique to create a visual of how to write the code for the desired visual output.
	- 4. Customize my webpage using Bootstrap.
	- 5. Equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations.

# Challenge

## Project Overview
Add additional filters with which to interact to enable users the ability to filter for specific data for a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.  Include the ability to filter by additional column headers, other than date, and pinpoint a search by date and country.

### Objectives
	- 1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
		- Add five filters based on columns headers:
			Date | City | State | Country | Shape
	
	- 2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
	
	- 3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

Suggested additional analysis:
I recommend including analyzing the data to find the total number of UFO sitings per country, per state, per city, per shape.  I think the Ufologists would find that to be very insighful information.
